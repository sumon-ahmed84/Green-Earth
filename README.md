1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
=>  var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped. const cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.

2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
=>  map() creates a new array by applying a function to each element, forEach() executes a function for each element without creating a new array, and filter() creates a new array with elements that pass a test.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
=>  Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing function expressions. They do not have their own this context.

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
=>  Destructuring assignment allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
=>  Template literals are enclosed by backticks (``) and allow for multi-line strings and string interpolation, whereas string concatenation uses the + operator and is less readable.
